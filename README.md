## Tasks done

- Make the generation time interval and the number range adjustable at any time.
- Integrate "Save" and "Load" functionalities. All generated numbers from each
channel should be saved and reloaded when required. If a new "Start" command is
issued after a load, the new numbers should append to the previous ones. Implement
some form of file versioning to save and check upon load.
- Implement unique colors for each channel, a numerical indicator, horizontal scrolling,
and vertical scaling for enhanced visualization.
